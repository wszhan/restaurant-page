            <div id="about-introduction-text">Chef Bu-Bu is a master panda chef in growing food and fine cuisine.
                Although he himself eats mostly bamboo, he cooks all kinds of delicious food that bring joy and
                happiness to his customers. He only cooks his own growing vegetables, and buys meats from trusted local
                vendors whom he has known for decades (although Chef Bu-Bu himself is only a few years ago).</div>
